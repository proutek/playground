Use (with node+npm)
-------------------
npm install
npm start

Comments:
- I'm pretty lame with CSS.
- HTML template could be taken into separate file like in modern frameworks with some inject-markup language (separation of view from model)


Time spent:
-----------
4h coding
6h html+css (especially css)
